The original purpose of this project, is proof my skills and abilities like Developer. Also i evaluate a one problem in a companies focus in the installation and maintenances of lightning rod. This companies need a smart (basic) control of the lightning rod installed, and the status of this devices. Why is this so necesary? Because this systems are focus on the segurity of things like buildings, structures and more, but also this system provided segurity at the people. 

For that reason, i built this software to manage the maintenances and the installations of this devices, also the maintenances and the criterios established by international regulations. This software if focus on a specific type of lightning rod, de-ionizing lightning rod.
